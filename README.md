C# version 1 was released in January 2002. It is a modern, general purpose programming language designed and developed from the ground up by the renowned Danish software engineer, Anders Heijleberg and his team at Microsoft.

I’ve heard Anders Heijlsberg say in an interview that with C# the goal was to provide the power and expressiveness of C++ and the RAD (Rapid Application Development) capabilities of Visual Basic.

C# is similar to Java in the sense that it runs within its own environment. Java runs within an environment known as the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) whereas C# runs in an environment known as .NET. Both the JRE and .NET run on top of the relevant operating system.

The first version of .NET is known as the .NET Framework which needs to be deployed to the target computer in its entirely and can only run on Windows platforms. But now, .NET has evolved into an environment that can run on multiple platforms like Windows, Mac OS, Linux, IOS, Android and more.

The .NET environment became fragmented in 2016 with the release of .NET Core, which enabled .NET to be cross platform and agile in the sense that only your application’s base class library dependencies need to be deployed to the target computer with your


The .NET environment became fragmented in 2016 with the release of .NET Core, which enabled .NET to be cross platform and agile in the sense that only your application’s base class library dependencies need to be deployed to the target computer with your application.

Then in 2020, .NET became unified with the release of NET 5, which meant that the confusion created by having two strands of .NET, namely .NET Framework and .NET Core, was alleviated.

The latest stable release of C# is a highly evolved, sophisticated programming language that allows you to create almost any kind of application that can run on multiple platforms. You can create a single code base that can run on multiple platforms, for example Linux, Mac OS, Android, IOS, in the Cloud, of course Windows operating systems and more.
